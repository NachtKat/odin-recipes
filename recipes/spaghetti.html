<h2>Delicious Spaghetti from Modena</h2>
<br>
<p>This delicious spaghetti comes straight from <em>casa di ferrari</em></p>
<p>You can make it at home very easily, lets get started!</p>
<br>
<h2>ingredients</h2>

<br>
<ul>
    <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
    <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
 </ul>
<br>


<h2>Directions</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong></p></li>
<p>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175
     degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong></p></li>

<p>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.

</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong></p></li>

<p>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. 
    Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</p>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong></p></li>

<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
     Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
     until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to 
     the bite, 
    9 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Step 5</strong></p></li>

<p>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet
     over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring 
     occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and 
     break down, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
     <p>Add a couple splashes of the pasta
      water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini 
      into small pieces
     with the edge of a spoon or spatula. 
     Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts..</p>
     <br>
     <li><strong>Step 6</strong></p></li>

<p>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
     Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</p>

     <br>
     <li><strong>Step 7</strong></p></li>

<p>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil and enjoy!</p>
